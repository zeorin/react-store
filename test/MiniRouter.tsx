/**
 * A minimal TanStack-Router-shaped router, built only on this package's public
 * API.
 *
 * Routers are the sharpest case for a concurrent store and nobody has written
 * one down. A navigation is a transition that suspends on its loader, so while
 * it is in flight the tree is showing the old route — and anything urgent the
 * user does in the meantime has to land on what they are looking at, not on
 * the route that has not arrived. That is rebasing, arrived at from the one
 * direction where it is not a contrived example.
 *
 * TanStack Router drives navigation through React transitions and TanStack
 * Query reads through useSyncExternalStore, so the pair inherits the de-opt
 * this package exists to avoid. This models the router half.
 *
 * Imports nothing but `createStore` and `useStore`.
